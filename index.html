            const add = function (a,b){

        Answer →
        <pre>
        → const Multi = (a,b) => a*b;

    <div>Q4.Print output:
        <pre> var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        → [Output:Undefined]value printed in console At line no.24
    </div>
    <div>
        Reason: The output value is Undefined because when the execution context was running ,before it could
        assign value to x, the x was called(console.log x).

        <div>
            Q5. "Print output:
            <pre>var x = 21;
            girl ();
            console.log(x)
            function girl() {
                console.log(x);
                var x = 20;
            };"
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            →[Output:21].value printed in console At line no.32
            <div>
                Reason: In the process of process of memory allocation the function was skipped after var x = 21, and
                then
                there was console.log(x), So the execution context took the first declared value of x and printed in the
                output.
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
            Q6. "Print output
            <pre>

    var x = 21;
    a();
    b();

    function a() {
    
    x = 20;
    console.log(x);
    };
    function b() {
    
        x = 40;
    console.log(x);
    };"
    </pre>
        </div>
        <div>→[Output:20,40].value printed in console At line no.47 and
            52</div>
        <div>Reason: In the M.A the x value printed as 21, then in the a function where the x was declared 20 before
            console.log(x) so, the after execution of function scope the value of x which was 20,
            and it was near so it printed x = 20. Same with the case of 40.

        if (n === 0) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);

        let num = 6;
      console.log(factorial(num))</pre>
